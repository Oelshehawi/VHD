# Implementation Planning and Execution

## Planning Phase

- Always provide a comprehensive plan before implementing changes
- Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
- Identify dependencies and potential challenges
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios

## Implementation Approach

- Understand the current codebase thoroughly before making changes
- Follow Single Responsibility Principle - each file handles one concern
- Create new files when needed to maintain clean separation of concerns
- Test changes incrementally to ensure stability

## Code Review and Validation

- Ask for confirmation when unsure about changes
- Explain algorithms and implementation details clearly
- Ensure backward compatibility when modifying existing code
- Validate that changes align with overall project goals

## Communication

- Provide clear explanations of what has been implemented
- Describe how algorithms work and their purpose
- Outline goals for the next phase before proceeding
- Maintain transparency about implementation decisions
