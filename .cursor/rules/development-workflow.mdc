# Development Workflow

## Git Workflow

- Keep commits focused and descriptive
- Use conventional commit messages when possible
- Commit related changes together
- Review changes before committing

## Code Quality

- Follow TypeScript strict mode guidelines
- Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent formatting
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Add comments for complex business logic

## Testing

- Test critical business logic thoroughly
- Validate API integrations
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Ensure UI components work across different screen sizes

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize bundle size by lazy loading components
- Use appropriate React optimization techniques (memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders
- Optimize images and assets

## Security

- Validate all user inputs
- Use proper authentication and authorization
- Sanitize data before processing
- Follow security best practices for API endpoints
