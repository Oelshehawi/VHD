## Business Logic Context

`docs/business-logic/` documents business logic that directly affects how this codebase should be implemented.

Use these docs as required context when making changes tied to:
- schedules or scheduling behavior
- travel-time and route-related behavior
- invoice lifecycle and payment workflow behavior
- cross-surface communication history behavior

If implementation details appear ambiguous, check the relevant business-logic overview first and align code changes to those rules.
